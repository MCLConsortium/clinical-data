# ðŸ§ª Clinical Data

This is repository for the Consortium for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions' **Clinical Data** application, including:

- A clinical data database
- An OODT micro-service for
- And a web-based analysis application

Or we might break this into three separate repositories. This is all up in the air right now.


## ðŸš™ Getting Started

Well you can run `db.sh` to create a local PostgreSQL database. You can then access it with:

    psql --username=mcl --no-password clinical_data

Or from SQLAlchemy with:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('postgresql://mcl@localhost/clinical_data')
```


## ðŸ“€ Software Environment

We're still figuring this out. ðŸ¤”

For now, there's a budding prototype in the `sickbay` subdirectory.
